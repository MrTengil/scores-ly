# scores-ly

Initiative by Joakim Sandstr√∂m. Tech support by Tobias Skarhed.

Programmatic representation of classical songs (TTBB). These songs are in the public domain.

## Features

- Generate PDFs (or other formats)
- Generate MIDI-files for part separately
- Use LaTeX to append the PDFs into a song book

## How

The files are written with [Lilypond](http://lilypond.org/). It is a good idea to separate the parts when writing so that the MIDI files can be correctly generated. There is a [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tclwyZr08bE) available for new users.

## Ideas
- Make good templates for generating song books
- Generate SVGs to display on a website, along with the playable MIDI-files.
